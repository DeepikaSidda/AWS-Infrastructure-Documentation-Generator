## 💰 Cost Optimization Benefits

- 🚫 **Find Unused Resources:** Identifies idle EC2s, stale snapshots, and unattached EBS volumes  
- 🧠 **Right-Sizing Suggestions:** Based on utilization data  
- 🧹 **Auto Cleanup:** Helps identify orphaned or zombie resources  
- 💵 **Track Cost-related Changes:** Correlates infra changes to cost spikes  
- ✅ **Enforce Cost-Saving Rules:** S3 lifecycle, encryption policies, etc.

## 🧠 System Design — AWS InfraDoc Generator

### 1️⃣ Scanning AWS Infrastructure in Real Time

The tool leverages AWS SDKs like **Boto3** or the **AWS CLI** to connect to your AWS account and automatically discover resources such as:

- EC2 Instances
- S3 Buckets
- RDS Databases
- Lambda Functions
- VPCs, IAM Roles, and more

It fetches metadata including:
- Configuration (instance types, encryption, policies)
- Tags (owner, environment, purpose)
- Relationships (e.g., Lambda triggered by API Gateway)
- Current state and usage

✅ This enables teams to maintain complete visibility of their AWS environment — no more manual mapping or outdated Excel sheets!

### 2️⃣ Generating Dynamic Architecture Diagrams

Using **Diagrams (Python)**, **PlantUML**, or **Graphviz**, the tool translates raw metadata into visual representations:

- Automatically generated from live infrastructure data
- Updated on each scan or change
- Exported as **PNG**, **SVG**, or embedded **Markdown**

📊 These diagrams offer clarity for developers, architects, and ops teams alike.

### 3️⃣ Producing Human-Readable Documentation

Transforms AWS resource metadata into structured docs:

- Includes configuration, regions, IAM policies, networking, security
- Output in **HTML**, **Markdown**, or **PDF**
- Easy to integrate with **Notion**, **Confluence**, or GitHub Wiki



### 4️⃣ Tracking Infrastructure Changes

Supports change detection and auditing via snapshots:

- Stores historical states in **S3 (with versioning)**
- Detects additions, deletions, and modifications
- Maintains changelogs for rollback and compliance
- (Optional) Alerting on unauthorized changes





### 5️⃣ Generating Automated Compliance Reports

Validates your infrastructure using:
- YAML-based rule definitions
- AWS Config Rules or Security Hub integrations

Checks for:
- Encryption enforcement (EBS, S3, RDS)
- Public access blocking (S3, EC2)
- IAM over-permissiveness
- Approved instance types or regions

📄 Compliance reports available in **PDF**, **JSON**, and **HTML** formats for easy auditing.

## ✅ Getting Started: Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- Python 3.8+ installed
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
- Proper IAM permissions granted for EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, IAM, etc.
